# Deploying to GitHub Pages

Follow these steps to deploy your application to GitHub Pages:

## 1. Create a GitHub Repository

If you haven't already, create a new repository on GitHub named `CodeCircuitChallenge`.

## 2. Initialize Git and Push Your Code

```bash
# Initialize git repository if you haven't already
git init

# Add all files
git add .

# Commit the changes
git commit -m "Initial commit"

# Add the remote repository URL
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/CodeCircuitChallenge.git

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

## 3. Configure GitHub Pages

1. Go to your repository on GitHub.com
2. Click on "Settings" tab
3. Scroll down to the "GitHub Pages" section
4. Under "Source", select "GitHub Actions"
5. GitHub will automatically detect your workflow file

## 4. Wait for the Deployment

The GitHub Actions workflow will automatically build and deploy your site whenever you push to the main branch. You can monitor the progress in the "Actions" tab of your repository.

## 5. Access Your Deployed Site

Once the workflow completes successfully, your site will be available at:
`https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/CodeCircuitChallenge/`

## 6. Custom Domain (Optional)

If you want to use a custom domain:
1. Add your domain to the CNAME file
2. In your repository settings, under GitHub Pages, add your custom domain
3. Configure your domain provider's DNS settings as instructed by GitHub

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### 1. Navbar Shows But Content Doesn't Appear
This is usually related to routing in the GitHub Pages environment. We've implemented a hash-based routing system that should handle this. If you're experiencing this issue:
- Check the browser console for any errors
- Make sure `useHashBasedLocation` hook is properly implemented in App.tsx
- Verify that all the sections have the correct IDs that match the hash fragments

#### 2. In-Page Navigation Not Working
Our application uses hash fragments to navigate to specific sections:
- Make sure section IDs (like "trip-dashboard", "packing-list") match exactly with the hash links
- Check that scroll behavior is properly implemented in the Router component
- Inspect the page structure to ensure sections are properly rendered

#### 3. 404 Errors on Direct URL Access
- Verify the .nojekyll file is present in the root of your deployment
- Check that 404.html is correctly configured to redirect to the main application
- Ensure GitHub Pages is properly set up in your repository settings

#### 4. Fix for Content Not Displaying
If content still doesn't display correctly:
1. Run the included test script to simulate GitHub Pages locally:
   ```powershell
   ./test-github-pages.ps1
   ```
2. Check browser console for any errors
3. Try clearing your browser cache or using incognito mode

### Understanding the Routing Solution

Our application uses a hybrid approach:
- Hash-based routing for page navigation (`#/route`)
- Fragment identifiers for in-page section navigation (`#section-id`)

The `useHashBasedLocation` hook is designed to differentiate between these two types of navigation and handle them appropriately.
