​🎉 About the Hackathon
​Welcome to CodeCircuit!

​This is not a design sprint. It’s not a concept jam. CodeCircuit is a front-end challenge where you take an idea and actually build it.

​You’ll pick a challenge from our list, design it your way, and ship a real, working web app that looks great and runs smooth.

​No teams. No backend. Just clean code, good taste, and your own spin on the problem.

​You will find the challenge list here.
